## 🚀 About Me  
Hi, I’m Yuval. I’m an M.Sc. student in Computer Science at Bar-Ilan University, currently finishing the final requirements of my degree in a direct excellence program, with a focus on Deep Learning and Generative AI.

My thesis focuses on improving text-to-image generation using diffusion models. I also worked on a web-based game platform developed for a research team, used for experimental purposes. In this project, I implemented AI agents that interact with human players, using various search algorithms and game theory techniques.

I have experience programming in Python, Java, JavaScript, and C. I enjoy breaking down complex problems and building clear, efficient solutions.

Outside of the technical work, I’ve served as Chair of the Computer Science Student Council and as a board member of the Student Union. I also volunteer weekly at a nursing home and have been doing so for over a decade.

I’m always interested in learning and exploring new technologies.
